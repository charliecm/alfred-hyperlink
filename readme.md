# Hyperlink

[Download v1.4](https://github.com/charliecm/alfred-hyperlink/raw/master/Hyperlink.alfredworkflow)

An [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow that lets you copy an open browser tab as an HTML hyperlink or Markdown link. This can be useful for pasting online sources into a document when doing research.

Type `copylink` or `copylinkmd` to see a list of open tabs. Currently, this workflow supports Google Chrome and Safari only.
